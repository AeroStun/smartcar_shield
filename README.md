# Smartcar shield

### Description
This repository, includes everything necessary to set up a Smartcar platform. The Smartcar, is an educational platform, which enables the user to develop various robotic applications in an affordable, pedagogic and easy way. It is intended for persons with basic programming knowledge and little to no experience of electronics, mechanics or robotics. More experienced users, should also find this approach convenient, due to its open source nature, high level API and object oriented design.

The platform, hardware wise is focused (but not explicitely dependent) around the Smartcar shield. The Smartcar shield is an open hardware PCB, that is effortlessly stacked on top of an Arduino. It includes an L293D H-bridge chip, that drives the motors, screw terminals to connect the motors and a battery to them and a GY-50 gyroscope module (based on the L3G4200D sensor). In [extras/eagle](/extras/eagle) you can find the design files for the board, in a modifiable form, using free software.
